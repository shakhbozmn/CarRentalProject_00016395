### Backend (`back` Directory)

The backend uses **ASP.Net Core** and follows a standard .NET solution structure:

- **Solution Folder**: Contains the primary solution file (`.sln`) that manages the backend structure.
- **Configuration Files**: Includes global settings like `.json` files for SDK and environment configuration.
- **Source Code**: Houses the core backend logic, services, controllers, and database connections.

### Frontend (`front` Directory)

The frontend is built with **Angular** and organized to manage client-side behavior:

- **Source (`src`)**: The main source code for the Angular application, containing components, services, and modules.
- **Public Assets**: Houses static files like images, fonts, and other assets.
- **Configuration**: Contains configuration files for Angular, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
